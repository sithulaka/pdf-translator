## Overview

PDF Translator is a Python-based tool designed to extract text from PDF documents, translate it into Sinhala using Google Translator, and save the translated content in a well-structured text file format. This tool is ideal for users who need to convert large volumes of PDF content into another language while preserving the structure of tables and pages.

## Features

- **Text Extraction:** Extracts text from PDF files while preserving layout information.
- **Translation:** Utilizes Google Translator for translating extracted text into Sinhala.
- **Table Identification:** Detects and formats tables from the PDF content.
- **File Management:** Saves translated content into text files, maintaining the structure of the original PDF.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Place your PDF files** in the `input_pdfs/` folder.

2. **Run the script** to process the PDFs and generate translated text files:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Check the output** in the `output_texts/` folder. Each PDF will have a corresponding `.txt` file with the translated content.

### Example

To translate a PDF named `example.pdf`, place it in the `input_pdfs/` folder and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The translated text will be saved as `example.txt` in the `output_texts/` folder.
